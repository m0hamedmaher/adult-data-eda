Title: Analyzing Adult Income Data: A Recent Project

I'm thrilled to share a project I recently completed during my internship at Creativa Institute. I worked on a dataset called "adult" from Kaggle, focusing on calculating the income for adult individuals. Here’s an overview of my work:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I conducted extensive EDA to uncover patterns and gain insights into the dataset.

Data Preprocessing and Analysis: Using powerful libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn, I cleaned, visualized, and analyzed the data to prepare it for further modeling.

Tools & Technologies:

NumPy: For efficient numerical operations and array handling.
Pandas: For data manipulation and structured data analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating insightful visualizations.
Scikit-learn: For preprocessing and implementing machine learning algorithms.
Project Outcome: The analysis and preprocessing of the data provided valuable insights into the income distribution among adults, helping to identify key trends and patterns.


This project was a fantastic learning experience, significantly enhancing my data analysis and preprocessing skills. I’m excited to apply these skills to future projects!
